# EllipticalScenGen

This Julia package provides tools for generating scenario sets using
the an elliptical method. This method is adapted is in particular
adapted to portfolio selection problems using tail risk
measures. However, some methods in this package will produce unbiased
samples and so can be used for general stochastic programs. The author
has a draft paper which can provide more details.
